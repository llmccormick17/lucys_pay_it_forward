    <h2> At Lucy's Pay It Forward Foundation, we know that the problem of homelessness does not lie with the unhoused persons, but wwith the systems in place that are designed to allow homelessness exist in the first place: Unfettered Capitalism. </p>
    <p> The very same economic systems that have been resposible for the colapses of societies throughout the pages of history.</p>
    <p> The same capaitalistic systems that gave rise to everything from camrecorders to shopping malls, as well as the downfalls there of through planned obscelecence. </p>
    <p> The same is essentially done to the American Citizen.</p> 
    <p> Capitalism has chewed up and spit out so much and so many in its neverending pursuit of profit.</p>
    <p> Lucy's Pay It Forward Foundation aims to fix multiple problems with one (multifaceted) solution.</p>
